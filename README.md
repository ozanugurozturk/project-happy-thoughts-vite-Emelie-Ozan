# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

We have agreed to work together as Emelie (github account: emeliese, e-mail: segell.emelie@gmail.com) & Ozan (github account: ozanugurozturk, e-mail: ozanugurozturk@gmail.com). We will firsst discuss about what to do and how to share the workload.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We used a simple sketch using MS paint to plan out the outline of the project, and decide on the structure.
We agreed on meeting up on voice chat to pair program and work on some thing together, and some things could be divided between us.
